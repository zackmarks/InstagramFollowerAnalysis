# Instagram Follower Analysis

## About

This repository has the code required to check the status on statistics about accounts you follow and accounts that follow you on Instagram.

Instagram allows you to download all of the data it has on you. Followers and accounts following are a part of that data.
To access that data, follow this pipeline on your Instagram account:
> Profile > Options > Privacy and Security > Data Download > Request Download > JSON

At this point, you should wait for an email from Instagram with the data request. 
When you do recieve that, follow this file pathline to access the two files you need:
> followers_and_following > followers_1.json & following.json

Have these two files (followers_1.json and following.json) in the same directory as the followers.py. The names given are default names. Do not change them.

## To Use
Have your versions of the downloaded data (followers_1.json and following.json) and followers.py in the same directory and run how you would normally run a program. 
You do not need to change followers.py. Please do not change the names of the downloaded JSON files, as Instagram gives them default names that work in the program.
